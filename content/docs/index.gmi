Welcome to the Salix Documentation project! This is the place for tutorials, guides and frequently asked questions for both Salix users and developers.

Documentation is generally split into three sections:

=> /docs/faq Frequently Asked Questions
=> /docs/user User Documentation
=> /docs/dev Developer Documentation

You can navigate the documentation or use the search bar for looking up specific terms. Note that the search function requires Javascript.

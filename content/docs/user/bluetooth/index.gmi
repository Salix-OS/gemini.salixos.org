# Bluetooth

## Installing firmware

Bluetooth should be working out-of-the-box if you selected the FULL installation set. But if you didn't choose FULL and you want to have your bluetooth hardware working you can install these packages:

```
bluez
bluez-firmware
bluez-hcidump
```

using the gslapt package manager

## Bluetooth frontend

Here it depends on the salix flavor you chose  ( eg : if you have chose KDE you should be able to find the frontend to deal with the bluetooth ) But if you don't have the program that deals with bluez or you dont see the bluetooth icon in the notification are then you should be installing :

```
blueman
```

a lightweight Bluetooth manager which can get the job done for you .

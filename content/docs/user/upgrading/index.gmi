# Upgrading Between Releases

Upgrading to a new Salix release is a straightforward process, and we've put together a series of tutorials to guide you through it. Below, you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade from one Salix release to the next. Please note that only upgrading to the next consecutive release is officially supported, so it's recommended to upgrade in sequence rather than skipping releases. Attempting to upgrade multiple releases at once is not recommended and may lead to unexpected issues.

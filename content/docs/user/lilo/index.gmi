# LILO

LILO (the LInux LOader) is the default bootloader for Salix for systems that use a BIOS, instead of an EFI implementation to boot. This page provides some tips with respect to LILO usage.

### LILO is loading slowly

Sometimes LILO is booting very slowly showing lines of dots on the screen. To fix this just add a line containing "compact" (without quotes) at the top inside the global section of /etc/lilo.conf by editing it through a text editor or LiloSetup; then reinstall LILO.

### Chainload another system or bootloader

With the two simple lines below you're able to chainload - which is much like redirection - another bootloader (or system) that is able to continue the boot process by itself:

```
other = /dev/partition
label = Name
```

where partition stands for i.e. sda1, sda5, etc.

Most often this is used to boot Windows by chainloading its own native bootloader:

```
other = /dev/sda1
label = Windows
```

However it also allows to chainload another LILO or GRUB instance if either was not installed in the MBR but on a separate partition. For example assume Fedora installed its bootloader on partition sda5 and Salix in MBR (sda). In such case we can load Fedora`s bootloader with:

```
other = /dev/sda5
label = Fedora
```

Just add these two lines below the global section of /etc/lilo.conf among other entries for Linux.

### Custom bitmap for LILO

This is quite easy with GIMP:

1. Take an image
2. Scale it to 640x480
3. Choose Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Indexed
4. Generate optimum palette (255 colors, you may want to experiment with dithering to gain quality)
5. Save as name.bmp (Windows BMP Image)
6. enable Run-Length Encoded during saving

Copy the new image to the /boot directory and specify its name in /etc/lilo.conf by finding and modifying the line:

```
bitmap = /boot/name.bmp
```

Reinstall LILO:

```
sudo lilo -v
```

If it complains about the bitmap then one of the steps above must have gone wrong. Here you find an example colored LILO bitmap for Salix

### Adding Memtest

Memtest is a useful tool that allows testing memory for errors. It is easy to add it to LILO menu:

1. Download memtest as Pre-Compiled Bootable Binary (.gzip or .zip)
2. extract it into /boot directory
3. rename to memtest to simplify LILO entry
4. add the two lines as below to /etc/lilo.conf below the global section among other entries for Linux and reinstall LILO

```
image=/boot/memtest
label=Memtest
```

### Restrict passing parameters

Passing parameters to the kernel with LILO is not restricted by default, so anybody can type ' init 1' and boot into single user mode. If you want to protect parameters with a password, add these two lines at the top inside the global section of /etc/lilo.conf :

```
password=define_your_password_here
restricted
```

Your system will boot as usual but it will ask for the password when someone wants to add a parameter to the kernel. Since the password is not hidden make sure lilo.conf is only readable by root:

```
chmod 600 /etc/lilo.conf
```

WARNING: This doesn't prevent a person who really wants to bypass this limitation from doing so. Such a person can still change data (e.g. root password or LILO password) by booting from another media (e.g. Salix LiveCD) unless BIOS booting sequence doesn`t allow it or by attaching the hard drive to another computer if he has physical access to it.

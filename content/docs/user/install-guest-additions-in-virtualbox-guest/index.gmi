# How to Install the Virtualbox Guest Additions in a Salix Guest

If you're running Salix inside a virtualbox VM, you'll find out that the virtualbox guest additions fail to install, with some kernel header error being thrown. In order to be able to install the virtualbox guest additions, you just need to install the kernel-source package. Reboot and the virtualbox guest additions will install with no errors after that.

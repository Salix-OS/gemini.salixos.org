# Restore Fluxbox Menu

If for some reason you messed up your menu in your Fluxbox installation, you can quickly restore it with:

```
cp /etc/skel/.fluxbox/menu ~/.fluxbox/
```

Alternatively, if you want to restore all default Fluxbox configuration you can run:

```
cp -R /etc/skel/.fluxbox ~/
```

# Boot Into Existing Installation on Hard Disk Using Installation CD

After installing Salix to hard disk my LILO or GRUB was broken. How can I boot into the installed system on the hard disk using Salix installation CD (not LiveCD)?

Put the Salix installation CD into the drive, reboot and when prompt appears type this:

```
hugesmp.s root=/dev/partition rdinit=    ro
```

where partition stands for your partition number (ie. sda2; sdb1, etc.) where Salix was installed and yes there is a space between rdinit= and ro.

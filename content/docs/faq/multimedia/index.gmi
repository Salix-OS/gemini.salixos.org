# How to Play Multimedia Files

By default, a new Salix installation supports playback of most free video and audio file file formats. If you want to add support for other, non-free formats, you just have to use the Salix Codecs Installer tool.

You can either use the GUI tool:

```no
Menu -> Multimedia -> Install multimedia codecs
```

or from a terminal, run:

```
sudo salix-codecs-installer
```

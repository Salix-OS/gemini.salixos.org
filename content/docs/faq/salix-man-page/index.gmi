# How to Read the Salix Man Page

## What is a Man Page?

The Linux manual pages are the reference documentation of the system user (from the basic user to the administrator via the developer). They include all the commands / functions available in the system. The way to read one is to open a terminal and run:

```
man the_command_you_want_to_know_about
```

Or if you want to use our GTK manual page viewer:

```
gtkman the_command_you_want_to_know_about
```

### Example

```
man slapt-get
```

## The Salix Man page

This manual page allows you to read the minimum vital to use your Salix Operating System. To read it, you can run:

```
man salix
```

This man page is installed by default and is included in the salix-man package.

# How Do I Upgrade to Xfce 4.18?

Salix 15.0 comes with Xfce 4.16 by default. Xfce 4.18 was released a few months after Salix 15.0 was released and we added an extra repository for it soon after.

So, if you want to upgrade your Xfce to version 4.18, all you have to do is add that repository to your slapt-get package manager configuration in the /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file.

For 64-bit systems, you can add this line:

```
SOURCE=https://download.salixos.org/x86_64/xfce4.18-15.0/:PREFERRED
```

while for 32-bit systems, you can add this line:

```
SOURCE=https://download.salixos.org/i486/xfce4.18-15.0/:PREFERRED
```

and then just upgrade your system:

```
sudo slapt-get --update
sudo slapt-get --upgrade
```

You'll probably want to log out of Xfce and back in after that. You will then be greeted with the shiny new Xfce 4.18 environment!

# How Much Disk Space Does Salix Need

For the three different installation modes available, Salix occupies approximately the following amounts of disk space respectively:

* FULL: 2.4GB
* BASIC: 1.4GB
* CORE: 840MB

So, depending on which installation mode you choose, you need to have a partition with at least that much space available.

These sizes are the absolute minimum that you'll require. You have to account for any extra software you might want to install and of course for all your files.

You should have at least some space available for temporary files (in /tmp) and package downloads (in /var/slapt-get). If you want to install extra software you need to make room for those too. You should also consider how much space you want to have available in your /home.

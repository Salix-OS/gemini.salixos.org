# Salix Mailing Lists

## salix-main

The salix-main mailing list is the main discussion and development mailing list for Salix.

All developers are requested to register as most of the development is discussed in this mailing list. Translators should also register, as notifications about new strings that need to be translated in the several software projects developed in-house are regularly posted here. All users are also welcome to register and share their ideas/opinions about everything concerning the project.

You can subscribe/unsubscribe and view the list archives using the salix-main info page.

The salix-main mailing list address is salix-main@lists.sourceforge.net. Messages to the list from unsubscribed users are moderated, so it may take some time until your email actually reaches the list and with a large enough moderation queue, they may be entirely missed. Messages from subscribed users will always reach the list instantly, so if you want to send an email to the mailing list, subscribing is a good idea.
